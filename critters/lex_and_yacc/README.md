# Lex and Yacc

This directory contains code from our work with incorporating lexical analysis for shell parsing. This code is fairly unstable and so we decided not to rely on it for the final deliverable, but it was a useful learning experince.

To run this code, use the shell script [run_think_shell](https://github.com/anushadatar/SoftSysThinkGridWorld/blob/master/critters/lex_and_yacc/run_think_shell.sh).
