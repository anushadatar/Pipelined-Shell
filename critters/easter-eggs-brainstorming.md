# Easter Eggs Brainstorming List

Here are the ideas we have so far for potential easter eggs for our shell.

- Vicky's game from last year
- Type "Think Python" and open up the pdf of it online
- Launch a Youtube video of Allen Downey's lecture
- Click a certain number of times and launch . . . something
- Type Vicky's name, generates a text image of her
- Type nonsense and instead of an error it will launch a random command
