##Project Goals

The goal of our project is to develop a functional UNIX shell.
Our minimum viable product includes:
Implementation of basic commands (ls, cd, rm, cp, mv, mkdir, man)
Understanding of how a UNIX shell is implemented
Stretch goals we could pursue include:
Implementation of more fun linux commands, like cal and sl
Support for piping, redirection, and globbing
Inclusion of exciting easter eggs associated with GridWorld
Creation of a basic text editor that works in the shell (like Vim)
 
##Learning Goals 
Our learning goals include learning more about operating-system level design and general C programming. More specifically, we would like to explore the intersections among different layers of abstraction associated with the Unix environment. We also want to improve skills in C programming, especially in environments that are not isolated examples.

##Progress
The two primary resources we have utilized is first, a tutorial to create a simple shell in C, which we all did as a first task. We are now trying to work more along the Purdue lab assignment document (CS 252) for a shell, as we felt it would help us get a better understanding of the various components of a shell. To do that, we split tasks among team members and iterated on different pieces of the complete shell, and we are now working on combining them.
Some of the integration issues have been more complicated to address - while individual pieces display functionality in isolation, combining the different components has yielded errors that are difficult to track and to process
 
##Current Work
Currently we are building and integrating our latest iteration of the shell. The three parts to the shell were split among the three team members: 
Lexical analysis parsing: Anusha
Command structure: Allison
Execution: Prava

Currently we are wrestling with various errors that occur, and are hoping to at least have a shell that can execute by 3/12. We then feel like we can spend the rest of the week fixing functionality errors that will inevitably occur. Over spring break, we will try to implement some of the Easter Eggs that we promised. Overall, we feel pretty confident in our knowledge of how a Unix shell works and feel like we have learned a decent amount so far - now, our task is mostly just following through and implementing a working shell.
