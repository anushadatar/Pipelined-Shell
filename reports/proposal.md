# Think GridWorld : A Shell 
## Allison Basore, Anusha Datar, and Prava Dhulipalla

# Goals
The goal of our project is to develop a functional UNIX shell.

Our minimum viable product includes:
- Implementation of basic commands (_ls_, _cd_, _rm_, _cp_, _mv_, _mkdir_, _man_)
- Understanding of how a UNIX shell is implemented

Stretch goals we could pursue include:
- Implementation of more fun linux commands, like _cal_ and _sl_
- Support for piping and redirection, and globbing
- Inclusion of exciting easter eggs associated with [GridWorld](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/classroom-resources/gridworld-case-study)
- Creation of a basic text editor that works in the shell (like [Vim](https://www.vim.org/))

# Learning Goals
Our learning goals include learning more about operating-system level design and general C programming. More specifically, we would like to explore the intersections among different layers of abstraction associated with the Unix environment. We also want to improve skills in C programming, especially in environments that are not isolated examples.

# Resources
There are a variety of online resources we hope to use materials from. We intend to consult a variety of resources instead ofjust emulating one or a few in order to learn as much as possible.

# Steps and Tasks
1. Create a basic UNIX shell that supports the basic commands. This task will be done by all team members individually so that all team members' knowledge has the same baseline. Completed shells should be functional and pushed to [critters/](https://github.com/anushadatar/SoftSysThinkGridWorld/tree/master/critters) directory in this repository.
2. Meet to consolidate basic shell design and finalize product to build off of. This will be done by all team members and should result in a consolidated file.
3. Explore future goals (do basic research, find resources, etc.):
- Text Editor : Anusha
- Piping and Redirection : Prava
- Fun Commands : Allison
- Easter Eggs : Allison and Prava

Note that all team members are responsible for brainstorming easter eggs.
