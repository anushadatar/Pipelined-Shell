# Think GridWorld: A Shell
## Allison Basore, Anusha Datar, and Prava Dhulipalla
## Inspired by: Victoria "Vicky" McDermott and Emily Lepert

This repository contains code and documentation associated with Olin College Software Systems SP19 Project One, which was an open-ended free-form side project. We chose to create our own UNIX shell in C with support for standard commands, piping/redirection/globbing, and a variety of easter eggs including a LISP interpreter and a text editor. 

Our final report, linked [here](https://github.com/anushadatar/SoftSysThinkGridWorld/blob/master/reports/report.md) contains a high-level overview of our project goals and implementation.
